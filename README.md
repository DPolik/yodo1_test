Live Coding Test: Chest Unlock Mechanic with UI Feedback

OBJECTIVE:
Create a simple system where a player can move, collect a key, and unlock a chest with UI feedback.

Requirements:

1. Player Movement:

Implement a basic character controller allowing movement (WASD or arrow keys).

2. Key Pickup System:

Place a key in the scene.
When the player touches the key, it disappears, and a UI message appears: "Key Acquired!".

3. Chest Unlocking:

Place a locked chest in the scene.
If the player has the key, they can walk up to the chest to open it.
If they donâ€™t have the key, a UI message appears: "Find the key first!".

4. Basic UI:

Display the UI messages dynamically based on player interactions.
